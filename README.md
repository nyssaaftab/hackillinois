# Project Description: 
We created a translation tool for the Bronze-Age cunieform language Hittite. We created a ML model that takes in images of Hittite characters and outputs its syllabic translation. Because there was not a dataset of Hittite characters and their translations, we created our own dataset of over 1500 data points - uploaded on Kaggle. Then, we created a GUI using Gradio that takes in both image uploads and user-drawn sketches and returns the syllabic translation. We hope this project will help increase interest in this ancient language and help preserve knowledge of it!
